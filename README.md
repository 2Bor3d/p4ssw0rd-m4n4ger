An easy-to-use console based password manager written in python. Please don't use this, it's not fully tested and there are better password managers out there. I recommend bitwarden. I created this password manager because I was interested in the challenge and didn't want to spend the time to read the sourcecode of bitwarden witch is far longer than my code because bitwarden has far more features. It still was a very interesting project, and I learned many things about encryption and hashing.

# Use:

- First run: Run main.py with python 3. Set a root password (if you forget it you can't reset it, and you have to reset the password manager). 

- List all commands: help

- Add password: add <site> <username> <password>

- Change username: change_username <site> <username>

- Change password: change_password <site> <password>

- List all passwords: list

- Delete password: delete <site>

- Close program: exit
